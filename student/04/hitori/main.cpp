/* Hitori
 *
 * Desc:
 *   This program implements a Hitori game with the game board of
 *   size 5 x 5. Each square in the game board has a number from 1-5.
 *   At first, each horizontal and vertical row can have several identical
 *   numbers, but the purpose is to remove numbers such that each horizontal
 *   and vertical row has no duplicate numbers. However, it is not possible
 *   to remove numbers in adjacent squares, and none of the remaining numbers
 *   (squares) can be isolated from the other ones, i.e. it is not possible
 *   to remove all numbers around it (from strictly above, below, left, right).
 *
 *   At first, the user is asked, if the game board will be filled with
 *   randomly drawn numbers 1-5, or with user given 25 numbers. In the first
 *   option, a seed value for the random number generator will be asked next.
 *   In the latter option, the user is asked to input 25 numbers.
 *
 *   On each round, the user is asked for coordinates, i.e. two numbers.
 *   The player wins if each horizontal and vertical row has at most one
 *   instance of each number 1-5. The player loses if they remove  a number,
 *   the adjacent number of which has already been removed or if a number
 *   becomes isolated.
 *
 *   The program checks the user-given coordinates. They must be inside the
 *   game board, and the square indicated by them must have a number, i.e.
 *   a number cannot be removed again.
 *
 *   When the game ends, the program tells if the player lost or won.
